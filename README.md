# Scott's dotfiles

### Setup instructions (OSX Only)
- bash setup.sh 
- **That's it.** 
- Three things at the end require sudo. Do not run the script as sudo, as brew doesn't like that

### TODO (Listed at top of setup.sh)
- Set the right click to the bottom right of the touchpad
- Automate iterm2 font selection (using defaults command?)
- Automate iterm2 profile
- Set browser as default browser (browser of choice atm is brave)
- Remove enter click on brew installation
- Add colors to the install messages
- See if applescript will do anything better than what is being done now
- Automate the dock setup (on the left with my expected setup)
