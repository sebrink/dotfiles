# Scott's dotfiles

## Setup instructions
### OSX
- bash setup.sh 
- Three things at the end require sudo. Do not run the script as sudo, as brew doesn't like that
### Linux
- sudo bash setup.sh
- If you would like to have your root login be the same, just run the script as root. Not with sudo, just as the root user.
