# Scott's dotfiles

### Setup instructions (OSX Only)
- bash setup.sh 
- **That's it.** You'll need to hit enter once for the brew installation, but the rest is totally automated. Three things at the end require sudo. Do not run the script as sudo, as brew doesn't like that.

### TODO (Listed at top of setup.sh)
- Automate iterm2 font selection (defaults command?)
- Automate iterm2 profile settings (defaults command?)
- Set Brave as browser of choice
- Remove enter click on brew installation
- Add the following programs
  - slack
  - spotify
  - spectacle
  - vmware-fusion
  - signal
  - vlc
  - vivaldi
  - google chrome
  - firefox 
  - virtualbox 
  - postman 
  - android studio
